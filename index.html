<p>I'm an independent contractor / consultant programmer living and working in Cambridge, UK. I like challenges.</p>
<p>I'm good at understanding and solving difficult problems. Having solved them I'm good at explaining the answers.</p>
<p>I've programmed commercially in many languages, from assembler on the bare metal to LISP on the JVM. I can see computer programs in terms of high level abstractions and in terms of nanosecond by nanosecond machine instructions shuffling bits. I can work at various levels of abstraction, and I can translate fluently between levels.
</p>
<p>I'm talkative, literate, lucid and friendly. I'm a good communicator and I write programs that are intended to be read by others. </p>

<p>I have a degree in mathematics from King's College Cambridge.</p>

<p>I've been fascinated by computers since I was a child. In my spare time I program for fun. </p>

<p> When it first came out, I was really interested in the new language Clojure, and started putting programs I found instructive on a blog: <a href="http://www.learningclojure.com/" >http://www.learningclojure.com</a>.
Slightly to my amazement, this used to get about 25,000 readers every month, and made me a name in the community. </p>

<p>I've twice been one of the 'language gurus' for the <b>dev8d</b> academic developer's conference in London</p>

<p>I regularly give lectures on computer science to bright teenagers at Villiers Park (<a href="http://www.villierspark.org.uk" >http://www.villierspark.org.uk</a>).</p>

<p>I run my own limited company (J.L. Aspden Ltd) and can be engaged through it. Please get in touch if you have something difficult to do!</p>

 2019 Copperleaf <br /><br /></td>
<td>
  <b>Clojure, MATLAB/Octave, GNU Linear Programming Kit, GLPK, Non-Convex Optimization</b><br /><br />
  I took a large real world non-convex optimization problem, reduced it to a simple model and worked out how to solve the model problem and prove the solution optimal.

[ This involved using the following techniques, which I list for the benefit of persons seeking CVs using search algorithms: operations research, management science, mathematical modelling, numerical analysis, numerical algorithms, decision science, machine learning, reinforcement learning, mathematical
optimization, linear programming, simplex algorithm, MILP, mixed integer linear programming, convex
optimization, non-convex optimization, logistics, planning, dynamic programming, policy evaluation,
value iteration, tabular methods, and markov decision processes ]<br /><br />

<td>
  <b>machine learning, R, gradient boosting, Python, xgboost</b><br /><br />
  Engaged to explain and then implement the gradient boosting algorithm, I taught them how it worked, wrote several demonstration programs, and instead showed them how to use a perfect existing open-source library which did everything they needed much better than I could ever have hoped to do.

2017 Solarflare Communications <br /><br /></td>

  <b>multithreaded high-performance C for Linux networking, Python, Octave, gdb, nose, unittest, SolarCapture, wireshark</b><br /><br />
  I designed, implemented, tested and debugged a line-rate packet timestamp reconstruction module for a new Cisco switch, the mathematics of which turned out to have many weird subtleties, as part of the SolarCapture network traffic capturing application. I also wrote a custom packet dissector for wireshark.<br /><br />

  <b>embedded C on MIPS,  Python, Verilog, tcl, expect, bash, QEMU, PCI Express, verdi, Precision Timing Protocol, mercurial, vnc, reviewboard, bugzilla</b><br /><br />
  Investigated a new silicon implementation of the Precision Timing Protocol, which turned out to be broken and bug-ridden. I fixed it. At one point I found a subtle bug in all the computers in the world, and sent Synopsys a patch, which after much discussion was accepted verbatim, and should be somewhere in your computer today.<br /><br />

  <b>Embedded C on MIPS in network card, Python, Verilog, PCI Express, Vendor-Defined Messages, MCTP</b><br /><br />
  Initially engaged to investigate the possibility of using vendor-defined PCI messages to allow network cards to communicate with other PCIe devices in servers. Ended up proving beyond doubt that it couldn't be made to work, hunting down the various problems, and fixing in silicon the ones that were under our control. All is now well.<br /><br />

2015 Knowledge Transmission<br /><br /></td>
<td>
  <b>Clojure, webserver, rapid prototyping</b><br /><br />
  Knowledge Transmission urgently needed a small gui to allow teachers worldwide to enter exercises, and their development team had quoted them six months. I made them a prototype in three days, and spent a couple of weeks hacking it around until they liked it. They seemed happy.<br /><br />

<td>
  <b>MATLAB, Octave, Python, Physical/Mathematical Modelling</b><br /><br />
  I helped the Engineering Department to 'turn the Manchester Velodrome into a Wind Tunnel', creating a physics model and an associated program to interpret live telemetry from races and training sessions.

British Cycling's startlingly good and somewhat unexpected performance at the Rio Olympics was directly enabled by this work.

2011-2012 Solarflare Communications<br /><br /></td>
<td>
<b>embedded C, encryption, IPSEC, verilog, system verilog, verdi</b><br /><br />I wrote software to control the Authentec EIP-190 encryption core in Solarflare's latest very-high-speed networking silicon. I also ended up diving into the chip design itself to correct problems with the way that the core had been wired into the chip, invented a new way of getting the chip simulation to sanity check its internals in minutes rather than weeks, and redesigned the scheduling algorithm in a way that speeded up the simulations without impacting on the real performance.<br /><br /></td>

<div>I made Java bindings to the Xen API, automatically generating them from the XenServer OCaml code.<br />
<br />
I wrote examples of how to use the bindings, which I re-used as automatic regression tests. Once I'd done this I wrote corresponding examples for Python, and made them into a tutorial introduction to the Xen API.<br />
<br />
</div>
<div>I wrote various little Python scripts to do useful things for a VM farm, including a pool monitoring plugin for nagios, and daemons to monitor hosts, and if necessary to restart them as gently as possible. I packaged these daemons for Debian and Red Hat Linux together with a curses based configuration UI.<br />

<p>I was engaged to implement a new user interface for a portable radio used by the emergency services. Intuiting from the design documents that the new interface might be worse than the old, I wrote a PC simulation first, so that marketing could work out whether they really wanted it. The project was cancelled, saving the company approximately <b><i>£20,000,000</i></b>, partly at my own expense.</p>

<br />
[It shortened the software development time by several months by directing our optimization efforts, and allowed us to use the CPU we'd originally planned to use, avoiding prohibitively expensive redesign and re-tooling. When I'd originally suggested it, it had been vetoed as impossibly speculative and difficult, so I wrote it as a hobby project and then sold it to the company for the time-only cost.]<br />
