<p>I'm an independent contractor / consultant programmer living and working in Cambridge, UK. I like challenges.</p>

<p>I'm good at understanding and solving difficult problems. Having solved them I'm good at explaining the answers.</p>

<p>I've programmed commercially in many languages, from assembler on the bare metal to LISP on the JVM. I can see computer programs in terms of high level abstractions and in terms of nanosecond by nanosecond machine instructions shuffling bits. I can work at various levels of abstraction, and I can translate fluently between levels.</p>

<p>I'm talkative, literate, lucid and friendly. I'm a good communicator and I write programs that are intended to be read by others. </p>

<p>I have a degree in mathematics from King's College Cambridge.</p>

<p>I've been fascinated by computers since I was a child. In my spare time I program for fun. </p>

<p> When it first came out, I was really interested in the new language Clojure, and started putting programs I found instructive on a blog: <a href="http://www.learningclojure.com/" >http://www.learningclojure.com</a>.
Slightly to my amazement, this used to get about 25,000 readers every month, and made me a name in the community. </p>

<p>I've twice been one of the 'language gurus' for the <b>dev8d</b> academic developer's conference in London</p>

<p>I regularly give lectures on computer science to bright teenagers at Villiers Park (<a href="http://www.villierspark.org.uk" >http://www.villierspark.org.uk</a>).</p>

<p>I run my own limited company (J.L. Aspden Ltd) and can be engaged through it. Please get in touch if you have something difficult to do!</p>

<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cbook/" >The C Programming Language</a>,

  <p> Samsung needed extensive refactoring done on an enormous code base that took more than three hours to build and unit test. They were planning to do it by hand. </p>
  <p>I managed to get the build process down to ten minutes and automate the boring bits, writing tools and scripts to implement provably correct transformations on their code, and managed to pour thousands of changes into their codebase every week without breaking anything or violating their strict coding standards, all while working remotely during the pandemic. </p>

  <p>I took a large real world non-convex optimization problem, reduced it to a simple model and worked out how to solve the model problem and prove the solution optimal.</p>

<p>[ This involved using the following techniques, which I list for the benefit of persons seeking CVs using search algorithms: operations research, management science, mathematical modelling, numerical analysis, numerical algorithms, decision science, machine learning, reinforcement learning, mathematical
optimization, linear programming, simplex algorithm, MILP, mixed integer linear programming, convex
optimization, non-convex optimization, logistics, planning, dynamic programming, policy evaluation,

<p>  I designed, implemented, tested and debugged a line-rate packet timestamp reconstruction module for a new Cisco switch, the mathematics of which turned out to have many weird subtleties, as part of the SolarCapture network traffic capturing application.

<p>  Investigated a new silicon implementation of the Precision Timing Protocol, which turned out to be broken and bug-ridden. I fixed it. At one point I found a subtle bug in all the computers in the world, and sent Synopsys a patch, which after much discussion was accepted verbatim, and should be somewhere in your computer today.</p>

<p>  Initially engaged to investigate the possibility of using vendor-defined PCI messages to allow network cards to communicate with other PCIe devices in servers. Ended up proving beyond doubt that it couldn't be made to work, hunting down the various problems, and fixing in silicon the ones that were under our control. All is now well.</p>

  <p>I wrote software to control the Authentec EIP-190 encryption core in Solarflare's latest very-high-speed networking silicon. I also ended up diving into the chip design itself to correct problems with the way that the core had been wired into the chip, invented a new way of getting the chip simulation to sanity check its internals in minutes rather than weeks, and redesigned the scheduling algorithm in a way that speeded up the simulations without impacting on the real performance.</p>

<p>I made Java bindings to the Xen API, automatically generating them from the XenServer OCaml code.</p>

<p>I wrote examples of how to use the bindings, which I re-used as automatic regression tests. Once I'd done this I wrote corresponding examples for Python, and made them into a tutorial introduction to the Xen API.</p>


<p>I wrote various little Python scripts to do useful things for a VM farm, including a pool monitoring plugin for nagios, and daemons to monitor hosts, and if necessary to restart them as gently as possible. I packaged these daemons for Debian and Red Hat Linux together with a curses based configuration UI.</p>

  <p>I solved some mysterious bugs in a project to split DSP code across several code pages, and then automated the build process and dependency generation.

Part of this involved writing a 900kb serial link protocol to work over a 10 metre cable in conditions of heavy interference (lots of fun with oscilloscopes!).

The project was cancelled, saving the company approximately <b><i>£20,000,000</i></b>, partly at my own expense.</p>
  <p>In an unconnected second contract I evaluated the ClearCase version control system, recommended against it, was overruled, wrote recommendations for its use, wrote an html tutorial and gave some training.</p>

<p>I helped design the software architecture for a pager. I implemented the store manager component (A tiny filesystem which was considered for patent.), and then shrank it from 6k to 2k of compiled code. <i><b>In my own time</b></i> I wrote a memory map and stack analyzer for the Keil C compiler which <i><b>saved the project</b></i>. </p>

<p>[It shortened the software development time by several months by directing our optimization efforts, and allowed us to use the CPU we'd originally planned to use, avoiding prohibitively expensive redesign and re-tooling. When I'd originally suggested it, it had been vetoed as impossibly speculative and difficult, so I wrote it as a hobby project and then sold it to the company for the time-only cost.]</p>
