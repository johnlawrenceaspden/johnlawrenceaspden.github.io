<p>I'm a independent contractor / consultant programmer living and working in Cambridge, UK. I like challenges.</p>
<p>I'm good at understanding and solving difficult problems. Having solved them I'm good at explaining the answers.</p>
<p>I've programmed commercially in many languages, from assembler on the bare metal to LISP on the JVM. I can see computer programs in terms of high level abstractions and in terms of nanosecond by nanosecond machine instructions shuffling bits. I can work at various levels of abstraction, and I can translate fluently between levels.
</p>
<p>I'm talkative, literate, lucid and friendly. I'm a good communicator and I write programs that are intended to be read by others. </p>

<p>I have a degree in mathematics from King's College Cambridge.</p>

<p>I've been fascinated by computers since I was a child. In my spare time I program for fun. </p>

<p> When it first came out, I was really interested in the new language Clojure, and started putting programs I found instructive on a blog: <a href="http://www.learningclojure.com/" >http://www.learningclojure.com</a>.
Slightly to my amazement, this used to get about 25,000 readers every month, and made me a name in the community. </p>

<p>I've twice been one of the 'language gurus' for the <b>dev8d</b> academic developer's conference in London</p>

<p>I regularly give lectures on computer science to bright teenagers at Villiers Park (<a href="http://www.villierspark.org.uk" >http://www.villierspark.org.uk</a>).</p>

<p>I run my own limited company (J.L. Aspden Ltd) and can be engaged through it. Please get in touch if you have something difficult to do!</p>

2011-2012 Solarflare Communications<br /><br /></td>

<b>embedded C, encryption, IPSEC, verilog, system verilog, verdi</b><br /><br />I wrote software to control the Authentec EIP-190 encryption core in Solarflare's latest very-high-speed networking silicon. I also ended up diving into the chip design itself to correct problems with the way that the core had been wired into the chip, invented a new way of getting the chip simulation to sanity check its internals in minutes rather than weeks, and redesigned the scheduling algorithm in a way that speeded up the simulations without impacting on the real performance.<br /><br /></td>

I wrote a script to generate odf documents, with graphs, from statistical input. I also allowed the two halves of the company to continue using their favourite tools by making a data mining tool to find inconsistencies between a CRM database and an ad-hoc hand-maintained Excel spreadsheet.<br />

<br />
<div>I advised on setting up and using the language, and on functional programming and modern DVCS, and particularly on the design of the Lensfield project, and I wrote a library for finding files and transforming filenames according to simple user-specifiable patterns.<br />
<br />
I prepared and gave some talks on the language for the <a href="http://dev8d.org/" >dev8d</a> academic developer's conference in London.<br />

<div></div>
<div>I made Java bindings to the Xen API, automatically generating them from the XenServer OCaml code.<br />
<br />
I wrote examples of how to use the bindings, which I re-used as automatic regression tests. Once I'd done this I wrote corresponding examples for Python, and made them into a tutorial introduction to the Xen API.<br />
<br />
</div>
<div>I wrote various little Python scripts to do useful things for a VM farm, including a pool monitoring plugin for nagios, and daemons to monitor hosts, and if necessary to restart them as gently as possible. I packaged these daemons for Debian and Red Hat Linux together with a curses based configuration UI.<br />

<div>I wrote the software for an AVR chip embedded in a dashboard mounted police radio console, as well as a PC test harness in Delphi. Part of this involved writing a 900kb serial link protocol to work over a 10 metre cable in conditions of heavy interference (lots of fun with oscilloscopes!). This software is currently in most British police cars, as well as in many other countries, and <i><b>no bugs have ever been found</b></i>.<br />

<p>I was engaged to implement a new user interface for a portable radio used by the emergency services. Intuiting from the design documents that the new interface might be worse than the old, I wrote a PC simulation first, so that marketing could work out whether they really wanted it. The project was cancelled, saving the company approximately <b><i>Â£20,000,000</i></b>, partly at my own expense.</p>
<div>In an unconnected second contract I evaluated the ClearCase version control system, recommended against it, was overruled, wrote recommendations for its use, wrote an html tutorial and gave some training.</div>

<div></div>
<div>I helped design the software architecture for a pager. I implemented the store manager component (A tiny filesystem which was considered for patent.), and then shrank it from 6k to 2k of compiled code. <i><b>In my own time</b></i> I wrote a memory map and stack analyzer for the Keil C compiler which <i><b>saved the project</b></i>. <br />
<br />
[It shortened the software development time by several months by directing our optimization efforts, and allowed us to use the CPU we'd originally planned to use, avoiding prohibitively expensive redesign and re-tooling. When I'd originally suggested it, it had been vetoed as impossibly speculative and difficult, so I wrote it as a hobby project and then sold it to the company for the time-only cost.]<br />
<br />
I'm told they made millions of copies of my store manager code, and <i><b>never found a single bug</b>.</i><br />
